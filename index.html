        <p>From creating wellness programs to developing instructional products, 
         the one true thing that describes me well is... I'M A CREATOR.
        </p>
        <p>I'm the Founder and Owner of <a href="http://www.primalplatoon.com">Primal Platoon, Inc.</a> 
           However, this year I've decided to slow down business operations to become a software developer.
        </p>
        <p>I'm currently attending a coding bootcamp, and freelancing as an instructional designer
           and corporate trainer.  
        <p>My goal is to break into tech to become a full stack developer.  I plan to 
           integrate my experience in wellness and adult learning with the technology (and software 
           products) that will help people live happier, healthier lives.</p>
        </p>
        <p>I live in Marlborough, MA with my wife, Daisy, and two children.  I enjoy 
           traveling to other countries with my family, and yes, trying out local craft beers
           in every country I visit. I happen to be a US Military Veteran, but I'll save my war stories
           for another day. </p>
